# Game Cart Macropad

All the links to this board seem to be dead. I found this post on Reddit along with the files; I cannot promise this is the same "game card macropad" but it seems likely. --EanNewton

*Note: it seems the link to the Fusion360 files is dead. I uploaded the dropbox link's files here.*

If people want to see what my 40% keyboard looks like. It's 3d  printed and designed by me too, down to the case and PCB. I have a lot  of spares too, given how circuitboard making works, so I may be putting a few of them up for sale or running a limited number group buy for them! I haven't figured out the price for my 40% yet, but the macropad will  be about $60 (CAD) 

### Big edit:

Oh wow, I didn't expect this to be so popular! I'm definitely going  to try and sell some of my spares this month then, along with looking at some avenues for a limited number group buy too. I'm exploring things  like resin casting for the cart so I can do things like make neat carts, as well as looking at professional 3d services like Shapeways, or  teaming up with a user from here. 

### Bigger edit:

Since I did this with the last one, I'll also share my design files  for people. The firmware for both will be coming this weekend, and I'll  even see if I can get it in to the official QMK list too. This link  includes the schematic, a picture of the board for populating, a bill of materials, gerber files for manufacturing at JLC PCB (not affiliated), a DXF for the steel plate, and the STL for printing.

This link is also for anybody handy with Fusion 360 as well, and lets you change the design to maybe make it just a PCB mount, or compatible  with a circuitboard you have! I'm sorry if some of the sketches are a  little odd, I'm still learning good form in drafting and design.
