## Finish

Care is taken during the manufacturing of the Wedge Case to produce the best possible finish, but
the Wedge Case is 3D printed which means that fine layer lines will be visible in the surface finish.
These close up photos are intended to show the imperfections!

A [cali cat](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1545913) is included with the kit in case you want to
experiment with a smoother finish. The case is printed using PETG plastic, you can read about
different options for [getting the perfect finish](https://all3dp.com/2/petg-smoothing/).

Threaded brass inserts are used for a secure and wear resistant assembly.

## Build Guide

Before assembling the Wedge Case you need to have assembled the [Torn PCBs](../../doc/pcb.md). Complete
the following steps for the left and right sides of your keyboard.

### Step 1

The assembled Wedge weights about 500g. If you want to add some weight for a quality feel and to
make sure it won't more around your desk you can add some extra weight at the bottom of the case.

A cost effective was to add weight is to use adhesive balance weights for car wheels. Below eight 60g
strips are used to add approx 500g additional weight. These are easy to buy from Amazon, for example

## Step 2

Press the insert firmly into the base. This is designed to be a tight fit, and it is important that
the insert is correctly seated.

Be careful if you need to remove the insert; you can use a small screwdriver to pry the insert up
by the connector gap.

## Step 3

Remove the steel plate from the protective wrapper.

## Step 4

Insert some MX switches in the steel plate and attach the completed PCB. Be careful not to bend the
switch pins.

## Step 5

Add the rest of the MX switch. Be careful not to bend the switch pins.

If you are not using Kailh sockets, you need to solder the switches to the PCB. You might want to
test all the switches are working before proceeding.

## Step 6

Put the steel plate and PCB assembly on the Wedge.

## Step 7

Put the trim over the steel plate. Remove the protective sheet on the acrylic cover and place it
over the trim. Use three M3 screws to secure the acrylic cover.

The completed keyboard weights about 500g for each half.

When using additional weights it is easy to increase this to 900g+ for each half.
