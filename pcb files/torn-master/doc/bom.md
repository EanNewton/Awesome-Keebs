### PCBs

There are several PCB manufactures that can produce small production runs, for example [jlcpcb](https://jlcpcb.com/), [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/) and [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html).
You will need upload the gerber files for the left and right PCBs. The latest version is published on [github](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn/releases/latest) or you can generate your own gerbers using [KiCad](https://kicad.org/).

At the same time you can also manufacture the optional PCB plate and base, also available on [github](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn/releases/latest).

### Components

You will also need to buy the components listed in the [bill of materials](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/5oG983n7). Most of the parts are easily available, with the exception of the USB C connector which is currently only stocked at Digi-Key in low volumes.

If you want the optional OLED display look for a 128X32 OLED Screen. This is the same OLED display used on the Corne and Lily58 keyboards, and available at many mechanical keyboard stores or [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32798439084.html).

Also optional are the Kailh MX Hotswap sockets, search for part number CPG151101S11.

### Cover
