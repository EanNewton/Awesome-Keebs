# **Tempest Mod (Tape Mod)**

The Tempest Mod or Tape Mod is a new mod made by oTempe5to (Tempest). **This mod uses a soft tape to absorb sound waves**. **The tape is put on the back of the PCB and is shown to improve acoustics of your keyboard (less reverb, cleaner sound).**  

## **How to do it?:** 

1. Open up your keyboard and make sure back of your PCB is exposed (Where the soldering or Millmaxes are located) 
2. Grab your tape of choice 
3. Cut and size accordingly (make sure to cut out holes for mounting and screw posts) 
4. Slap the tape nicely onto the back of your PCB 
5. Put your PCB back into your keyboard and screw it up  
6. Congratulations, you’ve just done the Tempest Mod or the Tape Mod (**YES, it’s that easy**) 

Tapes you can use are Washi Tape (oTempe5to used this originally to do the mod), Masking tape, or any other soft tapes. This mod’s ideology originates from ai03’s Flex Cut Taping mod.
