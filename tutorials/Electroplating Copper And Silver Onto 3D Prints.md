While researching copper plating graphite for a project, [Dave] stumbled upon a blog post illustrating a brilliant approach to [metal plating 3D printed parts.](http://bryancera.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/copper-electroplatingforming-3d-prints.html)

Our pioneers in this new technique are [Aaron], who runs [a jewelry business](https://www.facebook.com/Delandtree), and [Bryan], a professor of Digital Media. By mixing graphite powder  into an acetone solution, it is possible to make a kind of graphite  paint that sticks extremely well to ABS plastic.

Using the graphite painted part as the cathode, and a chunk of copper as the anode, it becomes possible to electroplate the part with a  variety of electro-forming solutions. In the first test (seen above),  [Bryan] uses a Midas Bright Electro-forming Copper Solution (copper  sulfate solution).

The electroplating process is the same as any other metal plating hack [we’ve covered](http://hackaday.com/2013/11/01/copper-electroplating-the-cheap-and-safe-way/), but if you’re a bit rusty on your chemistry knowledge, we’ve thrown in a little easy-to-read diagram to refresh your memory.

As the current flows through the solution, dissolved metal cations  form a coating on the cathode, creating a coherent plating effect — this process is called [electrodeposition.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplating)

The results are quite impressive — we can see how [Aaron] makes some  pretty cool jewelry combining 3D printing with this technique!

[Bryan Cera] is a Wisconsin maker who teaches digital media at the  Cardinal Stritch University. His studio work focuses on the  intersection of art, engineering and design.
