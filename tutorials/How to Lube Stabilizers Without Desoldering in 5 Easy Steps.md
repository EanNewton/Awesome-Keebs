So, you want to lube the stabilizers on your brand-new mechanical  keyboard, but all of the guides out there require desoldering the  switches first. Luckily, there is a method that requires ZERO soldering. We’ll explain in a step-by-step guide how to lube your stabilizers with no soldering at all.

**How to lube your stabilizers without desoldering:**

1. **Remove the keycaps with a keycap puller.**
2. **Cut a thin piece of plastic about ¼” wide. We used a plastic straw.**
3. **Dip the plastic into dielectric grease and insert into bottom of stabilizer.**
4. **Dip plastic into Super Lube and insert into sides of stabilizer.**
5. **Clean up excess lubricant with a cotton swab.**

We’ll go over each step more in-depth with images and explain what  mistakes to look out for, so make sure to follow along with the guide.

## What Are Stabilizers?

If you’re looking up how to lube your stabilizers, you probably  already know what they are, in which case you can skip this section.  Keyboard stabilizers are installed under each of the larger keys on your keyboard to keep them from shaking and rattling when typing. They are  typically mounted to the metal plate of your keyboard but can also be  mounted to the PCB. There are a few different mounting methods including clip-in, screw-in, and plate-mounted.

The style of mounting doesn’t matter much for the purpose of this  tutorial since we won’t be removing the stabilizers. But if you have the Costar style of stabilizer, the process will be different. This  tutorial is geared mainly to people with Cherry style stabilizers, so I  would double check really quick to make sure you have the correct type  for this method. You can see the difference between the two in the image below.

## Why Lube your Stabilizers?

You’re probably thinking, my stabilizers work perfectly fine, why  would I need to go through all of this effort to lube them? Well,  modding your stabilizers is one of the best upgrades you can make to  your keyboard, and there is very little equipment required. All you need are a few simple tools, some cheap lubricant, and a little time to  spare for the project.

Modding your stabilizers will reduce the rattling, mushiness, and  scratchiness of your current stabilizers, which will lead to improved  sound and feel of your keyboard. On a side note, it can be  super-difficult describing the changes in words, so I’ll have to rely on some bad-sounding adjectives to get the point across. But in general,  modding stabilizers = GOOD.

Upgrading your stabilizers is almost as good of an improvement to  your keyboard as lubing your switches. Most keyboards typically slack  when it comes to the stabilizer department, I don’t know why, but most  manufacturers just don’t put enough love into making sure their  stabilizers are stable, smooth, and supportive. Probably because they  aren’t the most exciting component, even though they make a huge impact  on the entire keyboard experience.

## Can you Lube Stabilizers without Desoldering?

Most guides out there will require you to remove the switches so you  can get full access to the stabilizers, and to remove the switches  you’ll have to take apart the case and desolder the switches from the  PCB.  With the desoldering method, you’re able to fully remove the  stabilizers, lube the switches thoroughly and do other mods as well such as band-aid and clipping. This entire process is pretty lengthy, but it results in some amazing feeling stabilizers.

There is a shortcut if you don’t have all of the soldering equipment  on hand or you don’t have the workspace for soldering, this involves  lubing the stabilizers while they are still installed in your keyboard.  Meaning, you won’t need to remove and desolder the switches or remove  the stabilizers from the keyboard. All you need to do is pop the keycaps off and make a small tool to apply lubricant to the stabilizers.

It’s worth noting that lubing your stabilizers without desoldering the switches is not as effective as the full [band-aid, lube, and clip mod](https://switchandclick.com/how-to-mod-your-stabilizers-band-aid-clip-and-lube/), but it will improve your stabilizers significantly. You should a  reduction in the amount the stabilizers rattle, how scratchy they feel,  and they will feel more stable than ever. If you don’t have the  soldering equipment on hand, we highly recommend you lube your  stabilizers with this method.

If your keyboard is hot-swappable, meaning the switches aren’t  soldered to the PCB, you can do the full band-aid, lube, and clip mod  without desoldering at all. You can remove the switches from the PCB  with a switch puller instead of using soldering equipment. We generally  recommend a hot-swappable keyboard for your first keyboard so you can do all of these fun mods without needing to worry about soldering.

## Tools Required

![super lube and dielectric grease bottles](https://switchandclick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_5298-1024x683.jpg)

- Keycap Puller
- Dielectric Grease (can find at any hardware store)
- Super Lube
- Scissors
- Tweezers
- [Interdental Brush](https://geni.us/IHJq2) or Plastic Straw/Tape
- Cotton Swabs

In order to lube your stabilizers, you’ll need a few basic tools to  get the job done. Most people should have everything on hand already,  except for the lubricants. You’ll need two types of lubricant:  dielectric grease and synthetic oil. The dielectric grease should be  relatively easy to find at a hardware store such as Home Depot or Lowes  and any brand should work, no need to be picky. For the synthetic oil,  you’ll  want something that is high viscosity, we used [Super Lube 51004 Synthetic oil](https://geni.us/kOjLU) and ordered it off of Amazon.

We also recommend getting a keycap puller, the keycaps on the  stabilizer keys can be pretty difficult to get off because they are  secured by the switch stem and the stabilizers. If you don’t have a  keycap puller, you could remove the keycaps by hand, but it can be a  difficult and slightly painful. A keycap puller is just a good tool to  have ready, in general.

The rest of the equipment is quite common. Any scissors should work, a plastic straw or tape will be needed, and a few cotton swabs for some  cleanup at the end. The cotton swabs can be replaced with paper towels  if needed. 

If you want the best equipment for applying the lube, an interdental  brush will work really well, otherwise you can make a tool yourself from a plastic straw or folded up tape.

## The Steps

### **Step 1: Remove the keycaps with a keycap puller.**

![keycaps being removed from keyboard](https://switchandclick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_5269-1-1024x683.jpg)

The first step involves taking the keycaps off of your keys. You  really only need to remove the keycaps off of the stabilizer keys such  as the spacebar, shift, enter, and backspace, but you can remove keys  around them as well so you have a little extra room to work.

As mentioned before you don’t really need a keycap puller, but it’s  definitely recommended for this project and future keyboard  modifications.  Using your fingers is a little bit slower and kind of  painful.

### **Step 2: Cut a thin piece of plastic about ¼” wide or use an interdental brush.**

![thin piece of plastic being cut](https://switchandclick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_5261-1-1024x683.jpg)

Next you want to prepare your tools. We will be making a small  plastic tool to apply lube into the stabilizers, we used a plastic straw cut vertically into a long 1/4″ strip. Another option would be to cut  up some packing tape and fold it several times until it’s relatively  solid. 

If you want a more professional setup, an [interdental brush](http://geni.us/IHJq2) gets the job done perfectly, but you’ll probably have to order those online through Amazon.

You could craft the tool out of other plastic objects as well, we  just used what we had on hand. The tool just needs to be thin, narrow,  and not too flimsy.

### **Step 3: Dip plastic into dielectric grease and insert into bottom of stabilizer.**

Now for the actual lubing part. You’ll want to take your plastic tool (or interdental brush), apply the dielectric grease to it, and insert  the tool into the stabilizer through the bottom section. Be generous  with the amount of lube, we typically apply lube twice for each  stabilizer.

You’ll want to work through each stabilizer and apply the dielectric  grease to the bottom area of the stabilizer. I typically like to pour  some of the grease into a small container and then dip our handy plastic tool into it for easy application. It helps to lift up on the stem  slightly with a pair of tweezers to be able push the lube underneath the stabilizer better.

Once dielectric grease has been applied to all of the stabilizers,  clean of the rest of the lube from your tool to prepare for the next  step.

### **Step 4: Dip plastic into Super Lube and insert into sides of stabilizer.**

In this step we’re going to be applying Super Lube to the left and  right side of each stabilizer. The process is very similar to the last  step, except you are using a different type of lubricant and applying  the lube to a different area of the stabilizer.

Apply a small amount of Super Lube to your plastic tool and gently  work it in-between the stabilizer stem and housing on the left and right side. The purpose of this step is to reduce the friction between both  parts when they rub.

You shouldn’t need to apply as much lubricant as the last step,  you’ll probably need to the dip the tool one time per each side of the  stabilizer. We recommend pouring a small amount of lubricant into a open container so you can dip your tool between application to speed up the  process.

### **Step 5: Clean up excess lubricant with a cotton swab.**

![cleaning up excess lubed after lubing with cotton swab](https://switchandclick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_5283-1-1024x683.jpg)

Once all of the stabilizers have been lubricated, all that’s left to  do is a little bit of clean up. With cotton swabs or paper towels on  hand, you’ll want to wipe up any excess lubricant that made its way  outside of the stabilizer. Any lubricant on top of the stabilizer stem  or plate will need to be cleaned. If you have trouble cleaning up the  lubricant, applying a small amount of isopropyl alcohol can really help  cut through the grease.

Once everything is sparkly and clean, simply put the keycaps back on and you should be good to go!

## Conclusion

Lubing your stabilizers without desoldering is a big time-saver and  can save you from spending money on soldering equipment. Lubing your  stabilizers is a big upgrade that we recommend everyone try out. While  this method works very well, it will not be as effective as the standard [band-aid, clip, and lube mod](https://switchandclick.com/how-to-mod-your-stabilizers-band-aid-clip-and-lube/), so if you do get soldering equipment someday we do recommend going back and doing the full modification.

We walked through the basics of what a stabilizer is, the benefits of lubing your stabilizers, the tools required, and the detailed steps. We listed out the entire modification process in five easy steps to help  you in your journey of making the perfect mechanical keyboard. 

We hope you lube your stabilizers so you can see for yourself, firsthand, how much of an impact it makes. Happy typing!
