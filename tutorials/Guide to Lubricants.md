## **Oil** 

* Krytox's 1 range are all oils. Ex. 104, 105, etc. used in blends to make thinner lubricants or for springs 

## **Krytox / Tribosys Grease**

* Used for the housings and stems. In most cases, the lower numbers indicate less viscosity and consistency.  

## **Lubricating Tactiles** 

* The lubricant and consistency of the lubricant can affect how tactile a switch is. That is why thinner lubricants are used to preserve that tactility. You can also use thicker ones but you must make sure that you do not lube the legs of the switch if you want to keep the tactility.  

## **Lubricating Linears** 

* With linear switches, you are given more leeway with what lubricants you can use. The main difference that will be felt isn’t the tactility but how the linear travel will feel. In most cases, Krytox 205g0 is the preferred option as it is easy to use as well as providing that buttery smooth feeling people seek.  

## **Lubricating Stabilizers** 

* For the housings, it is recommended to use the lubricating grease you use for your switches. This is just to make sure the stabilizers are smooth. For the wires, a thicker lubricant is more ideal (Consistency of Krytox 205g0 or above). Dielectric grease is perfect for this application as it’s thick enough and is cheap.  

## **Lubricating Springs** 

* For springs, most people would either hand lube the springs or use an oil to bag lube. The goal of lubing springs is to get rid of any spring noise created. If one is experiencing spring crunch, consider using a thicker lube.
