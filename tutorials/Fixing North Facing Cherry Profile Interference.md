North facing cherry profile interference can be an issue for many. However, if you have cherry profile and north facing there are still a multitude of solutions you can do  

## **Paper Keycap Modding** 

The idea here is to raise where the keycap sits, therefore making the switch not interfere. You basically stuff some paper in the keycap stem holes until it raises it enough to where there's no interference.  

<u>Pros</u> 

* Cheap 
* Convenient 

<u>Things to Note</u> 

* Requires you to manually level your keycaps 
* Risk of Damaging Keycaps if done improperly  
* Your keycaps will be raised a bit 
* Sound profile will be different from a south facing switch  

## **Ball Bearing Mod** 
One of my favorite mods to do to a switch. What you do is take a steel or brass ball bearing and put it inside the stem pole hole. Usually this ball bearing is 1.5mm in diameter, but you can usually go up to 1.8mm, sometimes 2mm. It is recommended you place the ball bearing in some lubricant before putting it in the stem pole hole so it does not rattle when in the switch. For cheap ball bearings (about $7 for 1000 shipped, take a look here: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001175695365.html 

<u>Pros</u> 

* Also Cheap (about 1000 bearings for $6) 

* Firmer Bottom out 

<u>Things to Note</u> 

* Reduced travel in your switches 
* Sound profile also changes on the bottom out 

## **Long Pole Switches** 

If you have a long pole switch, you don't need to worry about north facing interference. Long pole switches include Frankenswitches using the nk cream stem, Holy Panda, Boba U4T, Moyu Black, Glorious Panda, etc. To see if the switch you're considering is long pole, look here at [the switch database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uE7yEliE1t5mYYeFJa14iVhLe5udmA9-NgZuRxzZLe8/edit?usp=sharing) (Credits to @issey83) 

Long Pole Switches will feature a more firm bottom out with the sound being more pronounced, even more so than the ball bearing mod. Some people call these long poles "Thocky Poles".  

<u>Pros</u> 

* Firmer Bottom out 

<u>Things to Note</u> 

* Reduced travel in your switches 
* Sound profile changes on bottom out (More pronounced bottom out) 
* Long Pole Switches are typically more expensive than normal switches  

## **Switch Washers** 

Switch washers are put around your switch stems. It stops the keycap from fully seating all the way. Imagine if your keycap stems were elongated by .25-.5mm mm. That's what it does. https://olkb.com/products/north-facing-keyswitch-washers 

<u>Pros</u> 

* Easy to do 
* No permanent damage 

<u>Things to note</u> 

* Your keycaps will be raised a bit 
* Sound profile will be different from a south facing switch -
* More expensive compared to the other options (about $4 plus shipping for a pack of 120  

## **Using O rings (NOT RECOMMENDED)** 

This is a similar though process to the paper mod, but with o rings. You put these around your keycaps stems and it stops the interference.  

<u>Pros</u>

* Almost none lmao 

<u>Things to Note</u> 

* Bottom out is mushy 
* Bottom out sound is nearly silent (not very nice) 

## **Sanding down top housings (ALSO NOT RECOMMENDED)** 
You can sand down the area where your top housing meets the keycap. This requires irreversible altercations to the switch, your top out will feel less solid, and if done incorrectly will end up with your switches being scratchy. It can also be very difficult if your housing is made of polycarbonate or any harder materials. 

<u>Pros</u> 

* Barely Any 
* Solves North facing interference I guess 

<u>Cons</u> 

* Labor intensive 
* Permanent damage to your switches 
* Top out sound profile is worse
