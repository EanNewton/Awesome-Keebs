Hi, I use mill-max sockets a lot, and recently I've had a few people ask me questions about 'em. Here's what I know.

---

# **SOCKET INFORMATION**

The three viable sockets I've found are 0305, 7305, and 0279. All three work, but all 3 have benefits/drawbacks.

## **0305** 

These are reasonably cheap, and fit  damn near any keyboard. Compared to the 7305, they have a thicker lip,  but in my experience this has caused no issues (stablizers return  properly). The drawbacks to this socket are it's long tail. If you're  using a board with very tight spacing, they may be too tall and touch  the bottom of the board. You can fix this by sanding the bottoms, but  that's a lot of work. P/N used: 0305-2-15-80-47-80-10-0

## **7305**

These are just about identical to  the 0305, but they have a shorter tail and shorter lip. The short tail  makes them ideal for those tight builds I mentioned before. They're gold plated depending on the exact model you select. These are one size fits all, but they're annoying as heck to install due to the short tail.  When I buy these, I always buy 10 extra because it's nearly impossible  to get through an entire build without borking a few and getting solder  inside. P/N used: 7305-0-15-15-47-27-10-0

## **0279**

These are neat, I've started using  them recently. They have very long closed tails, and hexagonal lips  before the main lip to secure itself in place. No solder required  (disclaimer: solder required anyways). If you've got a PCB with nice  tolerances on the switch holes, you can press these into place with zero problems. Now, realizing we're not in a perfect world, the tolerances  are never perfect. Some holes are too small. When you push fit these  into a smaller hole, they expand the hole and frick the heck out of the  leads. You'll need to make a jump from a nearby switch to fix this. I've done 2 boards with these sockets and both needed 2 jumps. I use them  anyways because it's much faster to install these and jump them  afterwards (45mins-1hour) than to solder in 0305's or 7305's (like 2  hours or more). The speed scales with the # of switches you have to  solder. Fullsize boards are a BREEZE with these, lemmie tell ya. THESE  ARE NOT A GOOD OPTION IF YOUR PCB DOES NOT HAVE CIRCULAR HOLES. P/N  used: 0279-0-15-01-47-27-10-0

# **BUYING TIPS**

Utilize GBs where you can, of course, as it'll be much cheaper than  buying on your own. If you can't, use Octopart to find the cheapest  place you can snag the sockets. When I buy sockets, I tend to toss all 3 part numbers into Ocotopart and pick the cheapest one. I also tend to  look at other sockets that are similar, and if I consider them viable I  give those a go. Frankly, when a socket becomes popular, the price of  the socket shoots up. If you're the first person to find a viable  socket, you're in luck bucko, get some cheap while you can.

If you want to run a GB, ask me and I'll add a GB section to this 'guide'.

# **INSTALL TIPS**

For all soldering: use a small tip and use thin solder. I use kester 0.031 in. 24-6337-0027

## 0305 and 7305:

1) Put sockets on a switch.

2) Insert switch where it belongs, with sockets on the legs.

3) Solder sockets.

4) Remove switch

5) Repeat 1-4 until done. Use like 10 switches at a time. Use  switches you don't care about so that when you inevitably solder a  socket into it, it's no biggie.

## **0305 and 7305 help:**

1) Solder inside socket, but you can remove the switch:

- Take iron, press it onto the back of the socket. This will push it  out a bit after it heats up. Remove iron. Stand PCB on it's side, use  tweezers or whatever you've got, hold onto the top of the socket, and  press the iron on the back of the socket again. Once it heats up, use  the tweezers or whatevs to pull the socket out. Use the hand with the  tweezers to push on the PCB if needed.

2) Solder inside socket, and you CANT remove the switch:

- Heat up the socket and pull on the switch until it comes out.  Usually the socket will come out with the switch and you can just toss  it in the garbage. If the socket stays, but the switch comes out, see  #1.

3) Socket isn't flush with board.

- Rest 250C iron on the top of the socket for about 1 second. Push  socket down with conservative force. Should go down fairly easily. Wait  longer than a second for the solder to melt if needed. Don't push too  hard.

## 0279:

0) Make sure PCB is placed on top of something so there's room to press the sockets in.

1) Place sockets in holes via hand or tweezer.

2) Heat iron to about 250C.

3) Rest iron on socket for about 1 second.

4) Push socket into hole.

5) Repeat 0-4 until done.

6) Check all switches for continuity. Make jumps where needed.

# **RANDOM TIPS**

- When you put keycaps on your stablizers, it might push the PCB  off of the switches. I like to leave the board open until switches AND  caps are installed, push everything to fit again, then close up the  case.
- God tier QOL upgrade: add something non-conductive underneath the PCB to prevent the above issue and just to keep the PCB from backing  off in general. Bumpons or shelf liner are great for this.
- Related to above: if you have a floating PCB that's held on  mainly by the switches (Helix, Lets Split, idk others too probably)  DEFINITELY do the above 'upgrade'. It makes a world of difference,  because the PCB actually stays on when inserting and removing switches  lol. Just leave the 4 corners in when swapping switches, put the new  ones in, and swap the corners last. Much easier to work with this way. I use bumpons for my Helix.
