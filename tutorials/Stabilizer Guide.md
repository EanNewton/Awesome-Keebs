## **Choosing the right stabs:** 

Good stabs are key to making a mechanical board feel premium. 

Stabs come in 2 main varieties: *plate mount* and *PCB mount*. In turn, PCB mount comes in 2 varieties: *clip-in* and *screw-in*. Screw-in is recommended over clip-in. The type of stab you need depends on what your PCB and plate support; most prebuilts use plate mount. 

### The best screw-in stabs:

- C³Equalz V2

- Durock V2

- Zeal V2

Durock V1, Everglide, and Zeal V1 stabs are also all great.  


### The best plate mount stabs: 

- Everglide
- Durock
- Genuine Cherry

The Cherry stabs on KBDfans are cheap, bad clones. Don't buy them.  Reference: https://imgur.com/o5qrQ20 


### Stabs needed for different keyboard layouts: 

- 60%: 4×2u, 1×6.25u/7u 
- 65%-75%: 3×2u, 1×6.25u/7u 
- TKL: 4×2u, 1×6.25u/7u 
- Fullsize: 7×2u, 1×6.25u/7u  

These are general guidelines and may not apply to you. Always double check your specific keyboard.


## **Modifying stabs for sound and feel:** 

### Balancing: 

Place the wire on a very flat surface such as a smartphone's screen and push down the wire's end. If it wobbles or makes a noticeable sound, then that side is higher than the other side. Use pen caps or syringes to bend the wire sides until neither side of the wire has sound or wobble when pressed down. Do not flip the wire to its other side. 

### Lubing: 

Lube the wires and inside the sliders with Permatex Dielectric Tune-Up Grease, Super Lube Multi-Purpose Grease with PTFE, or the same grease you're using in your switches. Lube the inside of the housing with the same grease as your switches.

### Other Mods: 

- Clipping Cutting prongs off of stab sliders to stop them feeling mushy 
- Band-Aid PCB Placing foam on the PCB under the slider to dampen its impact 
- Band-Aid plate Putting tape in the plate's stab cutout to reduce wobble
- Heat shrink Putting heat shrink on the wire to reduce rattle
- Holee adhering foam inside the stab slider to reduce rattle: https://youtu.be/qmOSSqpHAws
