## **Guides:**

- [A Modern Handwiring Guide: Stronger, Cleaner, Faster](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Keebs/blob/main/tutorials/A%20Modern%20Handwiring%20Guide.md) 
-  [Hand-wiring a Custom Keyboard](https://matt3o.com/hand-wiring-a-custom-keyboard/) 
- [Handwired Keyboard Build Log - Part 1](http://www.masterzen.fr/2018/12/16/handwired-keyboard-build-log-part-1/)
- [QMK Hand-Wiring Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/hand_wire)

## **Tools & Other:** 

* [Irwin Vise-Grip Wire Stripper](https://smile.amazon.com/IRWIN-VISE-GRIP-2078300-Self-Adjusting-Stripper/dp/B000OQ21CA) - Not required but nice to have depending on the look you’re going for.  
* [Klein Wire Stripper/Cutter](https://smile.amazon.com/Stripper-Stranded-Klein-Tools-11046/dp/B0000302WS) - Any wire stripper will do, as long as it matches the gauge wire you have. 
* [28awg Solid Core Wire](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/pololu-corporation/2614/10451075) - I’ve found 28awg **solid core** wire is the best but anything from 22-30awg is fine. Highly recommend getting solid core wire as it’s much easier to work with compared to stranded core.  
* [Helping Hands](https://smile.amazon.com/Soldering-Flexible-Flashlight-Magnifying-Aluminum/dp/B085958VNK) - Not required but *handy* to have.  
* [Amoeba Single-Switch PCBs](https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/amoeba-single-switch-pcbs) - Not required but extremely nice to have on Dactyl style and other non-flat keyboards.  
* [1N4148TR Diodes](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/on-semiconductor/1N4148TR/9356376) - Almost any **1N4148 through hole** diode will do.  
* http://builder.swillkb.com/ or https://plate.keeb.io/ or https://kbplate.ai03.com/ and http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ - Use any of these plate generators and keyboard layout editor to build you layout. The plate is arguably the most important part of a hand wired build.
