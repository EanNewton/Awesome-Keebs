Using PTFE tape also known as thread seal tape, Teflon tape, plumbers tape, adds cushioning to stab wire so ticking is reduced or eliminated.

1. Wrap the tape 1.5-2 turns around the wire. More turns if the wire / stabilizer insert have loose tolerance.
   1. More turn = more mushy = better cushion = less ticking
   2. Make sure the start of wrap is clinging on to the long part of wire for a bit.
   3. You will need that to help tightens the wrap later or it will just spin indefinitely and loose and won't work.
2. Tighten by 2 finger grabbing tape and the other hand turning wire the other way. 
      1. Wrap the tape clockwise, turn the wire counter-clockwise, or vice versa.
      2. Tape will appear translucent after tightening (1 or 2 turns) or not (3 turns or more).


I use dielectric grease, you can use it dry, or with other lube and let me know if anything is incompatible. I will update if any is found or reported.

Specs of PTFE tape that I've tried:

```
12mm, 12.7mm
0.075mm/3mil, 0.1mm/4mil
```

Good Luck and Have Fun
