# Keeb How To: Custom Silicone Rubber Fill

I'm going to leak a couple of my secrets here, because I love the community and do not really believe in "secret sauce". 

I've tested a lot of methods -- not all of them, but a number -- and I feel the best approach really depends on the individual build; consider that my disclaimer, I'm happy to help with anyone's individual builds, the following method is my current, preferred, generalized method for this mod and changes as I try new things (that sometimes work, sometimes don't).

## Parts:

* 2-part silicone rubber, 
* A bag of cheap rice or similar "filler", 
* The bottom half of the case, 
* Some blue painter's tape, 
* A disposable cup or two; 
* An X-Acto knife

## Optional but preferable:

* A scale, 
* Hot glue gun,
* A bubble level,
* Spray can of mold release,
* Powdered pigment,
* Lead fishing weights or similar dense material

## Instructions

1) Completely disassemble the board.

2) Do any needed modifications to the case; e.g. milling work, painting, drilling, anodizing / patina, etc etc

3. Use the tape on the inside of the case to cover up any holes or places a fluid would leak out from. 

   Optional, if you have a hot glue gun you can then fill in the holes from the outside of the case, wait for it to set, then tape over it from the outside to help hold it in place, then remove the tape on the inside for a perfectly flat surface. Using just tape on the inside works fine but sometimes will get caught into the silicone and create little slice outs that just don't look very nice.

4) Lay the case half so the internal surface is flat; that is to say, if the board has a natural slant to it, from riser feet in the back or just the way it is designed, prop up the front half (this is where a bubble level is helpful).

5) Fill the case half with rice up to the standoffs minus a little bit or wherever is appropriate to get an estimate of how much silicone you will need and still be able to fit the board in. Pour it into the disposable cup and mark the fill point with a sharpie. Dispose of the rice.

6. Mix up enough 2-part silicone to reach your fill line, **following the instructions that come with it** (usually equal parts by weight, which if you don't have a scale going equal parts by volume will get you very close with most mixes). 

   Mix it very, very well. Bubbles are okay; with most mixes they will disappear on their own as it sets. I personally like to mix it with a plastic fork, I have no evidence but I feel it mixes more like a whisk than a paddle (like from the wooden popsicle sticks most people use) and I can just throw it away at the end.

   Optionally, you can mix in powdered pigments or mica powder or similar to give it a color, it will set to a cloudy white on its own.

7. Spray the case with mold release; aiming for using as little as possible to create an even and complete coat on the inside. 

   Optionally, you can lay the lead weights in the case at this point. The rubber will add a good amount of weight on its own but up to your preferences; the point being to add it after the mold release so the silicone will stick to it better. Likewise, if you are able to use weights with a non-flat surface that will get embedded in the rubber. 

8) Pour your silicone. Holding the case flat on the surface give it a little jiggle to make sure the silicone gets into all the crevices and is evenly distributed. Leave it to cure per the directions.

9) Pull your new custom rubber fill free from the case, go slow and be gentle. Use an X-Acto knife to clean it up. Remove the tape / glue. Assemble your board.
