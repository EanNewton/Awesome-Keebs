Northfacing is when the switch faces upwards, hence the north facing name. In keycap molds, there are “support bars” inside the keycaps which hits the top of the switch, creating a muted sound on bottom out. 

## What keycaps are affected by interference?

* For switches, 90% of the time it will happen on north facing, original mx style switches with 4mm travel. 

* For keycaps, it will most likely happen with cherry profile keycaps, however there are some cases of it happening with oem keycaps 

## Which manufacturers are known to have this issue?

- GMK on row 3 
- JTK on row 2
- Epbt on row 2 
- Crp on all rows 
- EPBT abs on all rows 
- All of that was tested with gat yellows.  

## What can I do about this?

You can prevent this by using paper, sanding down the switch, using small washers, or using switches that have travel less than 4mm such as holy pandas or kailh box switches.
