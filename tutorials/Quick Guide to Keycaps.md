## **PBT vs. ABS**

- ABS keycaps tend to shine over time, and are usually found only in (subjectively) ugly fonts on the lower end. 
- They also are harder to work with in high temperatures since they warp. However, they provide more vibrant colors than PBT. ABS keycaps are typically doubleshot as the dye sublimation process would end up warping them.  
- PBP keycaps don’t shine as much and also are more resistant to heat. They can be found more commonly dye sublimated as they are harder to work with in the doubleshot process but doubleshot PBT keycaps aren’t super rare either. 
- PBT keycaps also tend to give a deeper sound but the thickness of the keycap will he more impactful in that regard.   

## **Doubleshot vs. Dye-Sub** 

- Doubleshot keycaps have two or more layers of plastic to produce legends. They don’t fade over time for that reason. However, on cheaper doubleshot sets you may notice stenciled fonts as well as being able to feel the legends. This is due to cost reasons and tooling. 
- Doubleshot keycaps tend to produce crisper legends. 
- Dye sublimated keycaps dye the plastic itself. They also don’t fade over time but the legends are not as sharp as doubleshot. The dye sublimation process only allows for darker colors to be dye on to lighter colors. 

## **Keycap Profiles** 

- There are plenty of different keycap profiles out there, some very common ones being Cherry, OEM, SA, MT3, DSA, and XDA. They all will affect the feel and sound of your keyboard differently.  
- Keycap profiles also usually come in sculpted and uniform. Uniform keycaps are the same profile for each row whilst sculpted keycaps have a different height based on the rows.
