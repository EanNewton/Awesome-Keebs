## Solder Kailh hot swap sockets

[Demonstration video](https://imgur.com/ThIzfro)

- Place the Kailh hot swap socket into the holes of the PCB.
  - Ensure that the sockets are oriented so that they **do not** cover the center hole for the switch housing.
- Place the tip of the iron just barely on the interior of the socket tabs and flow solder from the outer edge.
- Solder one side, and then the other.
- Before moving on, audit your work.
  - Make sure the sockets are secured to the pads underneath them by wiggling them very little force using a pair of tweezers. They should not move.
