## **Keyboard Case** 
The part that houses the keyboard. Can be made in many different fashions and materials.  

## **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**

The most essential part of the keyboard. It controls everything from the switches to lighting. Can be available in many different orientations. 

## **Plate** 

Used to secure the switches in place, and in some cases to attach the keyboard to the case. Also used for acoustic reasons
