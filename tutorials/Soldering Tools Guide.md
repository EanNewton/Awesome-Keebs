## **Recommendations**

I’ll start with this; the most important thing is that you get an iron with temperature control. And  I recommend soldering at **300°c - 350°c or 580°f - 660°f**. 

- Flux isn’t required and not needed in most cases, useful for SMD soldering or other projects where contacts are close together.  

- If possible, **get leaded solder**. Lead free is harder to work with for beginners and requires a higher temperature.  

- **Solder in a well ventilated space.** Whether this be outside or next to an open window, make sure you have a small fan or fume extractor blowing the smoke away from you. Wash your hands once you are finished. The lead actually isn’t really the dangerous part, it’s more the flux fumes.  

## **Tools**  
* [Solder](https://www.amazon.com/Kester-83-4000-0000-SN60PB40-Solder-Diameter/dp/B00068IJNQ/ref=sr_1_3 ) - Almost any 63/37 or 60/40 rosin core solder will do.  
* [Cheap Iron](https://www.amazon.com/ANBES-Soldering-Iron-Kit-Electronics/dp/B06XZ31W3M/ref=sr_1_5 ) - Good cheap iron :3 
* [Good Cheap Iron with Variable Temperature](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32945257770.html)[^1] - KSGER T12 Soldering Station
* [Nicer, more expensive iron](https://www.amazon.com/UY-CHAN-Programmable-Pocket-size-Acceleration/dp/B01MD12DYT/ref=sr_1_6) - I recommend this if you want a better quality iron or  plan on continuing building keyboards in the future.  
* [Flush Cutters](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-CHP-170-Micro-Cutter/dp/B00FZPDG1K/ref=sr_1_5) - Not required but nice to have for cutting diode legs, clipping switch legs, or cutting wire.  
* [Small Fan](https://www.amazon.com/Aluan-Operation-Portable-Adjustable-360°Rotatable/dp/B07QXJ51YT/ref=sr_1_11) - Small desk fan is all you need for keeping the solder fumes out of your face.  
* [Tweezers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FZPFF96/ref=dp_prsubs_1) - Not required but handy to have for SMD projects and whatever else may come along.  
* [Hookup Wire](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/alpha-wire/2842-1-RD005/1953954) - Useful for fixing your PCB if you messed up a pad or trace. (edited)
